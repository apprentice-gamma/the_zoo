Welcome to the Zoo

You should have a Zoo and the Zoo should have a collection of Pens for Animals to go in. 

Create an interactive program which allows the user (the Zookeeper!) to:

1.) Create new Animals (animals should have a "species," "size," and "gender")
1.) Set up new Pens
2.) Remove Pens
3.) Add an Animal to a Pen
4.) Remove Animals from pens
5.) Display all the Animals in a Pen
6.) Display all the Animals in the Zoo

Bonus (choose any or all)
a. Your program should also allow the Zookeeper to add BabyAnimals to Pens. BabyAnimal should utilize Animal as a Prototype.
b. Your program should not allow the zookeeper to add more than (4) total Animals or (10) total BabyAnimals to a Pen.
c. Your program should not allow the zookeeper to add a BabyAnimal to a Pen unless you already have a male Animal and a female Animal living in the Pen.
d. Your program should include Habitats, which should describe what a given Animal's habitat is like (desert, forest, hot, cold, etc.).

Please let me know if you have any questions. You'll also have some time to work on this assignment in class tomorrow after lecture.
